## Description

Source of my capstone project for Palm Beach Code School. This is a crowdsourced submission voting site for tips and advice related to the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. 

It is not possible to build and run the site from this repo; the configuration file and several third-party components are missing. It is intended for reference only.
