# WDW-Tips

Author: Adam Beagle

## Description

Source of my capstone project for Palm Beach Code School. This is a crowdsourced submission voting site for tips and advice related to the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. 

It is not possible to build and run the site from this repo; the configuration file and several third-party components are missing. It is intended for reference only. 

A Google Slides presentation containing more information about the site [is available via this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSAAN89oeT9BMkfSY7FqLrJcJxte_c44TKglQVrnxlUOYglnsgKn1wT9YvDDVRECI2XbIFy353KSlPs/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000).
